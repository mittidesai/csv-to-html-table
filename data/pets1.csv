From your daddy, your mama, or whomever you met, you would pander to anyone just to get that pet. A treat, or scratch or a belly rub, no matter the person, you always had love./ They say that a dog is a man's best friend, he will wag his tail for you till the bitter end. In my darkest of hours embracing you on the floor, sobbing and weeping, I heard it once more. A familiar 'thunk thunk' of your tail hitting ground, was a signal to me of your love so profound./ Bringing comfort to me was your greatest of gifts, your unconditional Love, people's spirits it did lift. Once fate was decided and your time here was up, to the Rainbow Bridge we sent you so you could again be a pup. Run and play my dear friend, you are now free from life's pain. Your legacy of love and great memories remain./ You were beloved by all, many lives you did touch. And for one last long time your old body I did clutch./ A privilege that no one else could obtain, I laid next to you and stroked your old mane./ With tears streaming down, doesn't feel like they'll slow, I whispered... A Hui Hou my best buddy, A Hui Hou.""",

He learns three foundation tasks: retrieve, push, and tug. If someone wants something from the fridge, he can tug open the door, retrieve the medicine, and push the door shut. He's the 7th puppy I've raised; I love this job because I've taught each dog to help provide independence for someone that fought for ours.

In South Korea, 4 out of 5 dogs/cats are bought from a pet store and 17,000 puppy-mill operations are currently profiting off of this, keeping dogs and cats in horrendous conditions. Abandoned pets usually end up being euthanized, or worse, sold into the dog/cat meat trade. Several companies have sponsored a raffle with prizes to build awareness and help bring in donations to build 9 animal shelters – one in each province.

It's who she was. She had a little purple mouse – my husband said that was the start of it. All of her clothing had animals on it. She and Sammy would always hang out underneath the dining room table. She and her brother Freddy made business cards in kindergarten – she called herself the 'Caretaker of Catherine's Animal Shelter'. She once started taking food out and feeding a feral colony of cats in our backyard. She loved going to the Cape and gathering hermit crabs and would always put them back. There are just people who have that heart. She was drawn to animals and didn't discriminate. When Catherine died at Sandy Hook Elementary, we could've certainly crawled into a hole, and it would've been understandable. But Catherine deserves more than that. Freddy was at the school too. Left was Freddy, right was Catherine. If he had gone left, it would've been Freddy. Sammy knew when Catherine didn't come home. She was sad. She'd look at us like, 'Where's Catherine?'. There was something about Catherine's spirit – there was that special bond. What she taught us was so intense.

We had to submit letters of reference and I had to go in for a personal interview. They trusted him, it was me that they wanted to check out.

He was abusive towards us financially and emotionally and I wasn't allowed to have an animal in the house. I knew I shouldn't get the dog, but my sixth sense as a mother told me to get the dog.

Happy Friday ❤️ *I rescued Penny at 3 days old after her mother, who was bred too early, had no maternal instincts and turned on her litter. Of 5 puppies, only 2 were still alive when I arrived. I took them both, but unfortunately her brother did not even make the drive home. The first few days were touch and go, but under proper vet care, her having a 24 hour nurse (me) and adopted by foster ""mama"" - rescue boy Kilo, our Sweet P flourished. I documented her progress from day one on our Instagram page @roofusandkilo. Please enjoy some highlights from 3 days old to about 7 months as she became besties with Moo, harassed our old man Lucky for kisses, and mostly terrorized Roo and Bella.

There are also amazing adults in shelters who were once cute puppies but still somehow ended up there. And sadly THOUSANDS will lose their lives today because of backyard breeding and irresponsible ownership. Please please spay and neuter your pets. The breed will not ""disappear"". There will always be breeders out there, some good some not. Also these guys will be available for adoption in the PNW area only.

 Fortunately, James has Mahe, the devoted assistance dog who never leaves his side.  Recently, the New Zealand boy went to get an MRI scan to diagnose his seizures and Mahe was allowed to come with him, laying beside James in his hospital bed.  Even as James was being put under, Mahe remained devoted to keeping his young master safe, nuzzling his face. ""He was just looking at James, and looking really worried,"" Michelle Isaac, James's mom.  But while Mahe's help during the recent hospital visit was invaluable, Michelle says James's best friend has been just as important on more routine outings since entering their lives two and a half years ago.
 In addition to keeping James from wandering off or into harm's way, the dog trained by Assistance Dogs New Zealand Trust keeps James calm when they're out in a public, where he used to feel anxious and fearful. ""There is such a magic that happens between a child with autism and the dogs, they just calm the kids down,"" Wendy Isaacs, who works for the trust: ""The kids will maintain eye contact with the dog, but often not with their own parents and siblings.""

It's because the need is there, they are A LOT of work, and they fit best within our misfit pack. Thinking about adopting one yourself? Please remember they are a lifetime commitment. Most dogs enter the shelter between the ages of 9 months and 2 years. This is about the age where the puppy ""cute"" has worn off and you now have a rambunctious, sometimes rebellious ""teen"" on your hands. This to me is the hardest stage of dog. BUT, stick it out. Get help, talk to a vet or trainer. Make sure before adopting that you are prepared for this phase. After 2 or so life does get much easier! Also, you could always skip the puppy part and adopt adult dogs instead. My Kilo came to me at the age of 2 and he's pretty much perfect (well perfectly imperfect) 😊.

It's okay to keep scrolling 😊 I sometimes want to speak to you all on a personal level but I never know what's okay to share. What might be too revealing or embarrassing to put out there for the world to read. But today I'm making an exception in hopes that maybe I can help someone. I may delete this but at least I tried. 5 years ago today I was in the hospital. In a moment of desperation I ended up in a very bad situation. I was tired, didn't feel like I belonged, that anyone did or could love me, or that I even deserved it. I was constantly anxious, sad, ashamed of my feelings and my behavior, no matter what I had done. There were certainly things going on in my life that contributed to these feelings. But what I didn't realize is that the only thing we can control sometimes is how we *react* to these things. We can only change ourselves. Today someone wrote to me and told me I'm their hero. I immediately started to cry. I don't think 5 years ago I could've imagined having someone's true respect, let alone being called a hero. It's all very surreal. That's just a little of my story, everyone has one. What I want to share with you though is how I got through and out of that dark place.  First, mental illness is real. It is not something to be ashamed of. Anxiety, real anxiety, has been in my family for generations. Depression sometimes goes hand in hand with this. Then OCD, so on and so on. Many people around you feel exactly the same, you are not alone. Get help. Please. There are better days ahead. There are many ways of healing. Medication, natural medicine, support groups, yoga, sobriety, therapy, outdoor recreation - take advantage of what's available to you. Make yourself and your serenity a priority. I found mine by volunteering. I would take a terrified dog out of its cage outside for a walk. I realized how much we really had in common and that in that moment I was their hero. Their friend. I had love to give and so did they. They literally saved my life and I will live mine out saving as many of theirs as I can. I am so grateful today. Thank you all for being on this journey with me ❤️ #outofroom #hereforyou","tbt,outofroom,hereforyou"

As sad as it is for us that she's gone, we're not unique in losing a child – what's unique is the outpouring we received. We've created a sanctuary for a six-year-old who loved animals. We're sharing her life and what she stood for. Everything we're doing is about making her legacy live on. We don't want people being sad and heavy. There are still parts of Newtown that are still very hurt, unfortunately. That's why we're so adamant about having an afternoon that's innocent and carefree.

250k?! 🤗thank you so much!!! So grateful for all the love.  Since the humans are incapable of responding to all the comments and questions, it's probably a good time to answer some common questions, again. 
1.  What breed is Popeye?
We know he's a mixed breed, but no one knows for certain what mix. Some guesses are pomapoo or Pom yorkie. He's 11.5 lbs and neutered. We are aware of DNA tests, but we're fine with him being a mystery mutt.
2.  How old is Popeye?
We think he's about 4-5 years old.
3.  Where did you adopt him?
We found him as a stray over three years ago. He was only 7 lbs when we found him. 😢 Could not find his previous owners and at the time, couldn't find him new owners.
4.  Does he get to eat?
We feed him bits of anything that is safe for him.  We also carry his favorite snacks.
5.  How do you get him to sit in front of food without lunging at it? Did you train him?
No training, although he desperately needs some training on being around unfamiliar dogs and he loves hearing himself bark.  However, he's always been well behaved around food. Those who have been around us during photos will know that he just doesn't seem to care about the food. He's more interested in his dog snacks we use to capture his attention (pro tip!) He’s a strange pup and this behavior allows us to do what we do. 
6.  Where do you get his clothes and accessories?
Anywhere, from Amazon, @themaxbone, to other online shops. We try to tag the store or brand in each pic since we get asked often.
7.  Is he a service dog? Nope. We look for restaurants with a pet friendly patio (#petfriendlydining).
He has attended some media events where he was indoor.  We also like to keep him in his pet carrier (we have a few - @misopup @lovethybeast @wagwear).
8.  Do the humans work?
Yes, we have our own jobs, including a family restaurant, @dipsgrill in Alhambra. 😉 
More FAQs tomorrow!

Thanks again and we hope you continue to enjoy his food adventures as much as we enjoy going on them. 😊 🐶 puppy cuddles for all!

During first few years of his life Ki lived in a dirty backyard where he was bred with a female for a few litters. After I rescued him someone familiar with his past filled me in on the challenges he faced.  Food was scarce but he always let the mama dog and puppies eat first (to this day he still loses his mind with excitement for his kibble). He took care of all the babies and lived constantly outside with them, in all weather conditions. Both he and the female were surrendered to the shelter together, with Kilo only making it out on his last day. Ever since then (4+ years now) he has been my comfort, some days my strength, and my velvet covered sausage best friend. He's a special dude 💙 #adoptrescuefoster #rescuefamily","rescuefamily,adoptrescuefoster"

Quick misfit fam update: My daughter has been out of town so Pearl has joined forces with the fosters to become the three little amigos/terrors aka normal puppies. They keep me busy pretty much 110% of the day but are healthy and growing quickly. Bella was at the emergency hospital last Saturday. She was acting weird so I brought her in. She apparently has vestibular disease, basically old dog vertigo. All her blood work and vitals were fine so they sent us home after some fluids. Now she's back to her old self and perfectly normal, creatching around as usual. Just another minor heart attack for mom. Plus side Lucky is feeling amazing, running around fetching the ball and taking long 2 am strolls around the property. Kilo is still a perfect velvet sausage, Roo is still living life as his alter ego Roofus L Jackson, Moo is pushing and making out with rocks, and Penny is soft, sweet, and adorable. I have been very busy getting all the calendars sent out this week. It is only me in this Roofus and Kilo ""factory"" so I appreciate your patience so much! Also, someone sent paper towels to our po box from Amazon but they didn't come with a packing slip. I just wanted to say THANK YOU, you are my hero as I am going through them like crazy right now. We have a really cool project with @nwdogproject we are working on right now too, a senior sanctuary for older longtime shelter dogs to live their lives out at, peaceful and happy. Our friend @salomondrin is doing an awesome fundraisirer for us to help make it happen - more info to come!

He sleeps completely cuddled up against me all night and wakes me up with kisses. He doesn't shark attack with his little razor teeth like most of them do, and he is constantly sneaking into Lucky's bed for afternoon naps with him. Roofus played with him all morning and right now Moo is his big spoon. He hung out with little girls the other day and was so gentle and calm. We have some applications in but are also still accepting them. Request info info@northwestdogproject.org. Isn't it crazy to think his mom and litter were on an euthanasia list? It might seem unthinkable that it could happen where you are, but this is the daily reality in many areas of our country. Accidental and backyard litters are devastating our shelter system. Please spay and neuter your pets - it really is so so important. And before you ask OF COURSE I would love to keep him. But I have a mission and need the room for many more. Plus he's a little too ""normal"" for our misfit crew 😜💕 #rescuefamily #adoptrescuefoster @nwdogproject","rescuefamily,adoptrescuefoster"

3873,https://www.instagram.com/p/BCytH0ZljZx/,22205,1272,"❤️ ""Life with type 1 diabetes involves high and lows and lots and lots of needles, every single day. We trained Jedi  to alert us when Luke goes too low of too high. His alerts often beat the meters and he saves Luke from lots of the crummy feelings and health issues that go along with each (if you go back and look at our old videos and pictures  you'll see) but Jedi's job goes beyond alerting, he also saves Luke from being alone, from being scared, he is his constant companion. This you see right here was not trained, this is the bond they've formed, after three years of being together, seeing this love helps me deal with the fact that I can't make the needles go away.  Luke is getting a new continuous glucose monitor sensor inserted (it is a needle that leaves a wire under the skin.) We numb his arm prior but Luke still has anxiety about the insertions. Jedi knows when it's time and he will come from wherever he is in the house and lay on Luke while we do it, I know he can sense Luke's anxiety. 
This is the part of type 1 diabetes the rest of the world doesn't see and why for 4 years I have been sharing our story in hopes that other people will decide to learn more  and try to understand why #weneedacure."" -

3557,https://www.instagram.com/p/BKmLTV3hdAL/,22118,1868,"15 years ago someone found a black lab abandoned in a shopping cart outside a grocery store and brought it into a shelter where Kelly O’Connell was working. Kelly wasn’t looking for a dog at that time, but… “He came in, and I was like, yup. I’m taking this puppy home”. As time went by, Kelly met James Garvin, and they fell in love. They were getting married this September and wanted 15-year-old Charlie to be there more than anything. Sadly, Charlie had been diagnosed with a brain tumor earlier this year, and he was very weak… He had 5 seizures the week before the wedding. ⠀
Then, suddenly the week of the wedding Charlie had no seizures. He “seemed like a whole new dog,” O’Connell said. And guess what? He DID make it down the aisle. But he couldn’t make it back. So the bride’s sister (and maid of honor) Katie Lloyd scooped him up and carried him out of the ceremony. Then everyone ― including the bride and groom ― gathered around Charlie Bear and showered him with love. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Kelly said she could “see it in his eyes” that Charlie held on in his final days just for her - “I think he was really happy to be there”. He died peacefully at home, in front of the fireplace and surrounded by his family. Kelly said having Charlie at her wedding, and having photos to remember him by, “means the world”. ""If this story makes people hug their pet or remember a pet that is no longer with them with fondness, it has done its job,” she said. “I hope people understand that a mixed dog from a shelter that was tossed away can bring 15 years of joy and memories that last a lifetime.” - Credits: @9gag",

....
9.  How overweight are his humans and what are their cholesterol levels?
Just a lil bit overweight.  Momma's cholesterol level is normal, papa is a lil higher than normal.
10.  Are his ears always like that?
90% of the time. If he concentrates hard enough, both go up.
11.  What camera do you use for his pics?
iPhone camera.
12.  What is his favorite human food?
We think it's McDonald's chicken nuggets as it's the one item he gets super excited about.
13.  Do you do meet ups?
It’s very difficult for us to do one on one meet ups, but we’ve done one group meet and greet that was great fun and are hoping to do more in the future.
14.  Does he get recognized a lot?
Here and there.  If you see him, please feel free to say hi, and we’re totally fine with pictures.  Just look for the floppy ears or the loud, screechy ear piercing bark. 
15.  Are you ever going to visit other cities? 
Would love to travel more with him, but he didn’t do too well on our one hour flight to San Francisco.  However, we’re planning on visiting San Francisco again soon, and will try again.  If he does well on this flight, we’ll try to visit other cities with him and more #popeyetravels.
16.  How did you come up with his account idea?
We already enjoy taking food pics and when we realized how well behaved he was around food, we came up with his account idea. We wanted something different, fun and light hearted. We thought anyone can be a foodie, why not this lil guy? 😉 .

3503,https://www.instagram.com/p/BLbtzHNBs5_/,21552,697,"😍 A must read:  From time to time people tell me, “Lighten up, it’s just a dog,” or “That’s a lot of money for just a dog.” They don’t understand the distance traveled, time spent, or costs involved for “Just a dog.” Some of my proudest moments have come about with “Just a dog.” Many hours have passed with my only company being “Just a dog,” and not once have I felt slighted. Some of my saddest moments were brought about by “Just a dog.” In those days of darkness, the gentle touch of “Just a dog” provided comfort and purpose to overcome the day.

If you, too, think it’s “Just a dog,” you will probably understand phrases like “just a friend,” “just a sunrise,” or “just a promise.” “Just a dog” brings into my life the very essence of friendship, trust, and pure unbridled joy. “Just a dog” brings out the compassion and patience that makes me a better person. Because of “Just a dog” I will rise early, take long walks and look longingly to the future.

For me and folks like me, it’s not “Just a dog.” It’s an embodiment of all the hopes and dreams of the future, the fond memories of the past, and the pure joy of the moment. “Just a dog“ brings out what’s good in me and diverts my thoughts away from myself and the worries of the day.

I hope that someday people can understand it’s not “Just the dog.” It’s the thing that gives me humanity and keeps me from being “Just a man” or “Just a woman.” So the next time you hear the phrase “Just a dog,” smile, because they “just don’t understand.” -Author Unknown

Before we could investigate further she went to sleep peacefully yesterday and did not wake up. I am devastated. I was going to let this all process before I composed anything but I felt you all had the right to know as well, and perhaps it will help to share my grief. She will be buried beneath an oak tree here on our property. I'm so sorry that this is my post for today. Good bye my sweet creature. She was 10 1/2 years old 💔",

Being a dog has many perks, like not having to mess with things like taxes like the rest of you. It may be frustrating, but you’ve all got to do it, so why not make a difference with how you do it this year?

I’m partnering with @1040taxes because they are giving $2 for every tax return filed online through their site (1040.com) to @Healing_Waters, to provide clean water for families and communities around the world in need. I know the word taxes can make some of you cringe, but how awesome is it that you can make a difference with something as simple as your tax return? Give them a follow, and visit thier site for all the details. Use the code CLEANWATER for 10% off your federal and state returns.

It's because the need is there, they are A LOT of work, and they fit best within our misfit pack. Thinking about adopting one yourself? Please remember they are a lifetime commitment. Most dogs enter the shelter between the ages of 9 months and 2 years. This is about the age where the puppy ""cute"" has worn off and you now have a rambunctious, sometimes rebellious ""teen"" on your hands. This to me is the hardest stage of dog. BUT, stick it out. Get help, talk to a vet or trainer. Make sure before adopting that you are prepared for this phase. After 2 or so life does get much easier! Also, you could always skip the puppy part and adopt adult dogs instead. My Kilo came to me at the age of 2 and he's pretty much perfect (well perfectly imperfect) 😊. Check out Petfinder.com for adoptable animals of all ages! 🐶🐾💩 #rescuefamily #adoptrescuefoster","rescuefamily,adoptrescuefoster,nationalpuppyday"

Everyone has been pretty cute lately, ever developing their individual personalities no matter what age. I'll start with Lucky because - seniority... * Lucky Baller (AKC registered name, yes a rescue dog anyways) - turned 14 in February. Been with us since 9 months old. Did not get the memo that he's not 2 anymore. * Because of this lack of communication I am constantly having to protect him from himself. He still climbs stairs, chases cars, plays nonstop fetch, and inhales all of his food. * He has finally started showing signs of old man behavior lately. Basically, he does what he wants. He goes on self guided tours of the neighborhood (mostly our property), demands multiple middle of the night potty breaks (these last for what seems like an eternity each time), drinks water only from his stream, checks his strawberry patch many times daily (almost bud!), and actually goes inside on his own when he's tired sometimes (unbelievable). * He is just as obsessed with me as ever. If you want to know where mom is just look for Lucky. He is in the bathroom for every shower, and if I leave the room he follows even if it's just for a second. This makes me consider every time if it's really necessary or not to move so he doesn't have to. * I went out of town a few weeks ago and although the rest of the family was here, at bedtime he walked the house looking for me and crying. My daughter ended up having to sleep on the floor with him both nights. So, basically, I guess I'm not going anywhere anymore because that crushed me. * Lots of people ask where the strawberry 🍓 obsession came from. Really it's a food obsession in general, he's just discovered that there is a source and it's pretty much magic to him that they keep coming back. * Yes he's always yelling at me in pictures. He associates the camera with food and there is no time to waste when it comes to treats. 
#getinmybelly #notgettinganyyounger #timesawasting #idowhatiwant #rescuefamily * Up next, according to age order, is the magical Kilocorn 🦄","rescuefamily,idowhatiwant,notgettinganyyounger,getinmybelly,timesawasting,secretlifeofmisfits"

While we personally provide all the necessities ourselves, when fostering for a shelter or rescue all supplies are covered! Food, toys, potty pads, and of course vet care. You just need to give them love and care (and do lots of clean up! 🙈). But it is so worth it as you help save not only your foster pup but also make room in the shelter for another. Ducky is AMAZING, a tank, soo sweet, and super bald lol.

On the second day they celebrate the life of dogs and they honor the many roles that dogs play in our society. We have dogs in our houses as guardian of the house. As the legend also says that there is a dog at yama’s gate guarding the gate to the underworld. So on this day a big red tika is put on a dog’s forehead and a beautiful garland around the neck. After worshipping the dog, it is given very delicious meal. This day the saying ‘every dog has his day’ comes true; for even a stray dog is looked upon with respect. We pray to the dog to guard our house as he guards the gate of the underworld and to divert destruction away from our homes. On this day you can see dogs running around with garlands on their neck."" ❤️🐾👑 #nepaldogfestival",nepaldogfestival

Guinness has cancer at the end of his spine and a neurological condition.  Guinness continues to amaze me. For those of you who have had the chance to meet him, follow him on Instagram, or see him simply swim by— you know that Guinness is a special dog. (…and I’m not just saying that because I am his mom.) At just 6 months old, he was diagnosed with neurological issues due to being inbred by a breeder who cared about nothing but making money—and it has been a struggle for Guinness to exist in this world ever since. 
The difference with Guinness compared to other dogs, is he is a fighter. He has had cancer not once, but twice. He has had eye issues, hip issues, skin allergies, oddly shaped moles, muscular issues in his jaw, eye sockets, and face (also called masticatory myositis), he was born severely pigeon toed having arthritis in his front paws starting at the age of 2, and over 25 fatty tumors covering his body. He has been shaved, stapled, sewn, cut over and over again for 9 years and still is one of the happiest, most kindest & gentle dogs you will ever meet.

Mom will be staying here with us until she finds her own perfect family.

She walks absolutely perfect on leash, is completely gentle with all people even children, likes to play ball but is mostly chill - she really wants nothing more than to be in your lap giving and receiving love. She may even be good with other dogs but we will know more once she's away from her babies a bit. If you are looking for a constant companion, easy going friend Rosie is your girl ❤️ @Regrann from @nwdogproject -  Momma Rosie loved all the attention she got last weekend at her puppies meet and greets, but you know what she'd love even more... a meet and greet of her own!! 🤗 
Her pups will be headed home with their families in just a couple weeks and we'd love for momma to have a family of her own to join not long after. As of now we are looking for an only dog home, but this babe does wonderfully with kidos and adores every human she meets. 
If you're interested in learning more about Rosie or would like to inquire about adopting please email us at adopt@northwestdogproject.org

I had this cart made for Hank in early December when he really was not doing well with his recovery. When the cart finally arrived and I saw Hank in it for the first time I had a mini melt down. It killed me to see him like that and I said I would NEVER put him in it again unless it was the last resort. I never even really told many people that I had the cart. I had been, and still am, really struggling with the decision we made to do the surgery. I know it is great that he is not in pain anymore but now his lack of mobility breaks my heart. I have shed so many tears over the situation he is in. I know deep down that we did the right thing but some days it is just so hard to see that. Any way, when we saw Dr. Bailey last week, she really convinced me to give the cart another shot. Not as a permanent/full time thing but just for Hank to get some exercise. (He needs it!) So I stopped being so selfish and finally put him in it tonight and got him moving a little! It will certainly take time for him to get used to it but it looks promising. He will be back in the dog park in no time"" - @adwarfable_hank",

Two years later, I was searching rescue sites and other for an older lab for my dad. He had one yellow lab pass away from old age and his second yellow lab passed away unexpectedly in the yard three months later. In my search, I received an email from a family in the Twin Cities that wanted to rehome their fox red lab named Nigel. Nigel was only two years old and had been trained for all kinds of hunting. He was too young of a dog for my dad, so we made arrangements to meet him and his family. We fell in love with him right away and he fell in love (or perhaps lust) with our female lab. Within 10 seconds of freedom in his new home in the countryside, he killed and retrieved one of our chickens. How is a trained bird dog to know that flushing and retrieving chickens was off limits? Well, Nigel killed seven chickens that first summer, retrieved two porcupines 😳 and kept life interesting. He has since realized his freedom isn't going away and has mellowed out significantly. He and Sugar are only two days apart in age and they really have become the best of friends. Shortly after adopting Nigel, I found an 8 year old chocolate lab for my dad. Funny how some things just work out"" - @lampsonlife",

@labsandfriends

Meet Riley👀 Oh My Stunning Boy!! Riley is a 2-3 year old chocolate Labrador who washed up in the Carson Shelter. Riley is as sweet as he is good looking! Riley came in neutered, so he was clearly someone's companion but sadly they never came looking for him.

Riley is a typical young lab, full of energy, excitement and ready to go! He would benefit from some leash manners, but is eager to please and ready to learn! Riley appears to be house trained, well socialized and just a happy, fun loving boy!

If you would like to foster or adopt RILEY, please email dogs@labradorsandfriends.org or fill out our online application at www.labradorsandfriends.org 
RILEY is located in Southern California

PLEASE spread the word about #RILEY.  Help to find a forever home by sharing, reposting, tagging your friends.  It really does help!  Thank you!",riley

So grateful for all the love.  Since the humans are incapable of responding to all the comments and questions, it's probably a good time to answer some common questions, again.

1. What breed is Popeye? We know he's a mixed breed, but no one knows for certain what mix. Some guesses are pomapoo or Pom yorkie. He's 11.5 lbs and neutered.
2. How old is Popeye? We think he's about 4 years old. 
3. Where did you adopt him? We found him as a stray over two years ago. He was only 7 lbs when we found him. 😢 Could not find his previous owners and at the time, couldn't find him new owners.  Plenty of takers now! 
4. Does he get to eat? We feed him bits of anything that is safe for him.  We also carry his favorite snacks. 
5. How do we get him to sit in front of food without lunging at it? He's always been well behaved around food. He's more interested in his dog snacks. 
6. How overweight are his humans and what are their cholesterol levels? Just a lil bit more since 50k. Momma's level is normal, papa is a lil higher than normal.
7. Are his ears always like that? Yes. 
8. Where do you get his clothes and accessories? Anywhere, usually Amazon or other store. We try to tag when we can.
9. Is he a service dog? Nope. We look for restaurants with a pet friendly patio (#petfriendlydininginla). He has attended some media events where he was indoor.  We also like to keep him in his pet carrier (from @wagwear, another common ask)
10. Do the humans work? Yes, we have our own jobs, including a family restaurant, @dipsgrill in Alhambra. Come check it out!
11. What camera do you use for his pics? iphone camera.
12. What is his favorite human food? We think it's McDonald's chicken nuggets. He loves it! .
Thanks again and we hope you continue to enjoy his food adventures as much as we enjoy going on them. 😊 🐶 puppy cuddles for all!",petfriendlydininginla

Love is blind: Couple marry after their dogs guide them to true love. A case of puppy love has led to the wedding of two guide dog owners - with the bride saying their pets helped her find “true love”.
Claire Johnson, 50, and Mark Gaffey, 51, got married in Baralston, Stoke-on-Trent, after their dogs fell in love at training two years ago.
The guide dogs, Venice and Rodd, took the happy couple through the service and even acted as ring-bearers.
The course where Gaffey and Johnson met involved nearly 14 hours of training a day for 12 days straight. The couple said the training program was so hectic that they gave no thought to romance at the time.

Once the course ended, Johnson and Gaffey still had weeks of training to complete with their dogs back at home. After they finally qualified to take their dogs on outings, the pair met up with Rodd and Venice for coffee. And then for another coffee. And then for lunch. And then for another lunch. “The lunches started off at about an hour, and then I think our longest lunch was 3 hours 40 minutes,” Johnson recalled. “In fact, we nearly got chucked out of the bar!” Gaffey and Johnson eventually made plans to have a nice dinner together at an Indian restaurant — just the two of them, with no love-struck dogs around. Before dinner, Gaffey sent a text message to Johnson: “If you’d let me, I could make your world a whole lot happier.” Ever since that night, Johnson said, “It’s (been) history, basically!” Gaffey wound up proposing to Johnson in the most public of ways: On camera for the British ITV show “Me and My Guide Dog.” “Now what did I say? ‘Would you do me the honor of being my wife?’” Gaffey recalled. “Yes that’s what you said,” Johnson answered. “I said to him yes, on the condition that he wouldn’t change.”",

The name this dog was given when she arrived at the shelter (Chautauqua County during the fall of 2012). Her owner had died and no one wanted her. She was soon adopted but she didn't really like small dogs. 
Several weeks ago she was given to a lady in Independence, Kansas where Ma escaped. She nearly made it back to Sedan. The Senior Lab walked nearly 30 miles to come home only to be rejected by her former family once she arrived. Her ""family"" can not take her back because of the little dogs. 
Her life has since become a fairy tale. Ma Kettle's story went viral, catching the attention of an animal-loving heiress -- who has now whisked the dog off in a private plane to Odessa, Florida -- about half an hour from Tampa -- where she'll live in an 11,000 square foot home on 100-odd acres, with a whole menagerie of furry rescue companions.

Virtues that few people get through life without abandoning, at least once.” This picture was taken after the Earthquake in Quito, Ecuador. A dog laying down in the house in which he once lived, waiting for his owners to appear.

On Saturday night (6:58 pm) a 7.8 magnitude earthquake hit the coast of Ecuador and generated over 350 aftershocks between the cities of Pedernales and Cojimies (north of the coastal province of Manabí). Reports of lost lives rise up to 413 and over 2,000 people are injured. The most affected cities are Manta, Pedernales and Portoviejo, according to the national Ministry of the Interior. In Pedernales over 60% of the infrastructure has been destroyed and they are still looking for over 150 missing people. Several cities in the sierra and amazon regions of Ecuador are coordinating volunteer efforts and sending donations that can supply immediate needs.

In my profile there is an official link if you would like to make a donation to the people affected by this earthquake. Your relief donations will help Global Shapers increase their capacity to offer emergency relief items to families who have lost their loved ones and their homes. Your donations will be used to purchase and deliver first need items such as: blankets, drinking water, canned foods, first aid medicine, mattresses, and clean clothes.

The reality is, however, that there are thousands of men and women struggling every single day with the emotional and physical wounds of war. We’re teaming up with the HEARTGARD® Plus (ivermectin/pyrantel) team and @WarriorCanineConnection to help bring the healing power of dogs to Service Members, Veterans and their families. 
From now until June 30th, we want to give you the chance to nominate a U.S. Service Member or Veteran for a chance to win an all-expense-paid trip to Nashville and a year’s supply of HEARTGARD Plus for their dog. Veterans can be nominated using the hashtags #NominateAVeteran and #Sweepstakes on Twitter® or Instagram®…or by following the link in my profile to heartgardians.com.

So here’s to loving unconditionally, because we all deserve that.  #ad","nominateaveteran,ad,sweepstakes"

As a therapy dog my training means I can work at many different facilities or hospitals. Visiting hospitalized kids is the most popular but the ones who need us & appreciate us the most are the elderly. Some are bodily well but might have neurological difficulties due to age. Some are mentally fit but physically inactive. Whichever it is their reaction is the same. Their eyes light up & they are so full of love. We will all be old one day & we don't wanna be invisible when we are. I have the best job on the planet! Check  my stories every Wednesday for my therapy visits!",

Glaucoma is a very painful condition in which high pressure in the eye occurs, causing inadequate fluid drainage. If not treated, it will cause permanent damage to the optic nerve, resulting in blindness. Lily lost one eye several years ago and her mom is trying desperately to save her other eye. She is a healthy playful girl who loves life and has not let glaucoma slow her down, until just recently. Lily is in constant pain and her eye requires constant medication. Lily's mom has met with an Ophthalmologist and there is a surgery that can be performed to prolong Lily's vision. It has a high success rate. If Lily does not get this surgery her eye will have to be removed, leaving her completely blind. To take her eye now, when she can still see, is heartbreaking and hopefully it will not come to this. Lily's mom is struggling to keep up with the medical bills and needs help to raise the funds for the surgery to save sweet Lily's eye. She has set up a 'You Caring' page and would greatly appreciate any help (all receipts are provided there and quotes posted). If we all come together #igfamily we can make this surgery happen, save Lily's eye and make a huge difference in the quality of Lily's life. Link is in our bio. Let's do this! Thank you! 💛 #igstrong #savelilyseye","igstrong,igfamily,savelilyseye"

SEATTLE (AP) — A black Labrador named Eclipse just wants to get to the dog park. So if her owner takes too long finishing his cigarette, and their bus arrives, she climbs aboard solo and rides to her stop — to the delight of fellow Seattle bus passengers.

The dog and her owner, Jeff Young, live right near a bus stop.

In Young's words, ""She's a bus-riding, sidewalk-walking dog."" Young says his dog sometimes gets on the bus without him, and he catches up with her at the dog park three or four stops away.

Bus riders report she hops onto seats next to strangers, and watches out the window for her stop. Says commuter Tiona Rainwater, ""All the bus drivers know her ... she makes everybody happy."" A Metro Transit spokesman says the agency loves that a dog appreciates public transit.

1. What breed is Popeye? We know he's a mixed breed, but no one knows for certain what mix. Some guesses are pomapoo or Pom yorkie. He's 11.5 lbs and neutered.
2. How old is Popeye? We think he's about 4 years old. 
3. Where did you adopt him? We found him as a stray over two years ago. He was only 7 lbs when we found him. 😢 Could not find his previous owners and at the time, couldn't find him new owners.  Plenty of takers now! 
4. Does he get to eat? We feed him bits of anything that is safe for him.  And yes, we know he can't have chocolate. We also carry a bag of his favorite snacks. 
5. How do we get him to sit in front of food without lunging at it? He's always been well behaved around food. He's more interested in his dog snacks. 
6. How overweight are his humans? Just a lil bit. 
7. Are his ears always like that? Yes. 
8. Where do you get his clothes and accessories? Anywhere, usually Amazon or some special boutiques. I try to tag when I can.
9. Is he a service dog? Nope. We look for restaurants with a pet friendly patio (#petfriendlydininginla). He has attended some media events where he was indoor.  We also like to keep him in his pet carrier (from @wagwear, another common ask). .
Thanks again and we hope you continue to enjoy his food adventures as much as we enjoy going on them. 😊 🐶 sloppy wet puppy kisses for all!",petfriendlydininginla

Cecil Williams, 61, was making his way to the dentist at 9.30 am with his 10-year-old black Labrador Orlando when he suddenly felt faint and began to wobble perilously close to the edge of the platform.
His longtime buddy desperately tried to hold him back from falling by pulling at his leash.

He has an actual passport and no preference for regular or goofy footed stance. (He also gets to travel as a regular passenger on international flights). He has won the Tandem pair division three times and this year he also won the dog-only Shredder division, during the 8th annual Surf City Surf Dog event at Huntington Beach, #California. Also, Ivan Moreira and Bono broke the Guinness World Record for the Longest Stand Up Paddleboard (SUP) ride on a river bore by a human/dog pair, for their impressive 1,690.5 meter (1.05 miles) journey down the Mearim River in Arari, Maranhão, Brazil, earlier this year. Congrats!! 🌊🏆 - @bonosurfdog","brazil,california,dogs"

His name is Cooper and 2 years ago, someone left him on the side of the road at a general store in Missouri. He has one blind eye, and that's why they suspect someone abandoned him. The proprietor of that general store took him in and 2 years later, he roams around the entire town and has a place to stay in several homes nearby, including the general store. He has total freedom and gets to meet all kinds of travelers passing through the town. It's refreshing to hear a story where the good in some people outweighs the bad in others"" 🌟- @ioeduffy",

He’d sniff the air and go hunting for all the bottles littered throughout town. Once he found a bottle, he would crush it in his mouth and then give it to his owner, Sandra Gilmore, who then recycled it. Over a 6-year period, it’s estimated that Tubby recycled as many as 26,000 water bottles during his twice-daily walks. Gilmore believes he recycled as many as 50,000 bottles in his lifetime.

Sadly, Tubby died not long ago at 13. But his big smile and his enthusiasm for recycling will be felt for years to come. He’s a cuddly reminder that one individual can have a huge impact on the world just by recycling.

Instagram info, in case you didn't know! Instagram only shows the most recent 100 notifications. This includes a mix of likes, comments, mentions, and new followers. I hit 100 notifications anywhere from 1 to 30 minutes. So if you mention me in a comment I usually miss seeing the notification for it, unless I'm looking at the activity page and happen to see it as it shows up 😕 I do always read the comments on my recent pictures and try to reply as much as possible. If you post a picture of me and use Tag People when you post along with your mention of me, it will go in my Pictures of You section so I won't miss it. Also, you can only hashtag your own photos to show up on that hashtag page #TheMoreYouKnow  #Instagram","themoreyouknow,instagram"

At the 1st slaughterhouse, I loss myself. And I cannot, even though I know I need to - I cannot disconnect how everybody tells me I am supposed to.

I die when they torture them. I feel helpless when who I am cannot reach out to save them. 
And it is the end that I know I need to remember. It is the end that I know I have to hold dear to my heart. Because in saving a hundred dogs or just one, if I cannot get the government to enacts laws, there will always be dogs that are tortured.
They hang them, beat them till you would think they cannot beat them anymore, then boil them alive as their screams rip apart your heart. 
I spent tonight in emergency. I was beat and assaulted. But still managed to escape with one dog. They chopped off her feet. And as she screamed while they cut her into pieces. I lost all sanity, and pushed in to save her.

While I was attacked, I shielded her. While they assaulted me, I defended myself and protected her. In the end, the bruising and blows to my body, they will heal. In the end, I lived to continue my mission.
I named her Hero. Because that is who she was for me in that moment. Innocent. Brave. Enduring. 
After I made certain she would live, I went to the hospital to get X-rays and to have my wounds attended to. The emergency doctor made me begin a 5 course rabies immunoglobulin treatment that will span 28 days.

I am going to bring Hero back home to the states. I am going to get her prosthetics so she can walk and live a life full of promise. She's going to be the symbol of so much struggle and suffering.

She will be the light that guides me as I journey to the largest and most dangerous operation in #Cambodia. I am mounted. My heart is strong.  It is 4:30 am, and I am headed out into the jungle to meet the slaughter. See me on the other side when I surface. Hold me in your heart. Tell me in a voice so I believe it. Tell me that a world where humanity is preserved - that it exists.

I believe, because believing is all I can do in my #heart."" - @animalhopeandwellness","heart,cambodia"

But not a lot of people think of me as a good dog rather they choose to stay away from me or demand precautions from my pawrents for them and their kids. Like if I'm a Tiger in the city.

People who dislike me all because I'm a dog, must know that I'm adopted by humans and raised among them. I have learned to live with humans and I've been disciplined in many ways you (dog haters) can't imagine.

Family dogs are good to be friends with.

Today's #DogCrushDaily is cuddly lil' tufty flufty @munchkintheteddybear. Wait, sorry, not sure how I missed this, but upon further review, it looks like Munchkin is actually a teddy bear and not a dog: we see her in no-dog territory; we see her eating her delicious kryptonite, honey; and we see her skateboarding, which I'm pretty sure bears just love to do.This is so strange... how did I choose to feature and make a collage of a bear, when this is clearly #DogCrushDaily, a page for featuring dogs only? All I remember is looking into those sweet brown eyes and getting very, very confused, because I had such a strong feeling of love wash over me that I've only ever felt for pups. Sorry guys! My mistake! No more bear features... Just dogs. Cub score: 9.5/10","dogcrushdaily,repost"

----------
Over 10,000 dogs are killed every year in southern China for the annual Yulin Festival. These dogs are pets that are stolen from their homes and families and horribly tortured before being killed so their meat can be eaten at the festival, EVERY YEAR. I won't list the horrific details here but you can find them everywhere under #StopYulin2015. This hashtag is helping to get attention and is making a difference.
This years festival is set for June 21, 2015. PLEASE help stop it from happening by signing a petition. There are a few out there; Humane Society International, @animalasia, and change.org to name a few.
Go to their sites or Google search ""Stop Yulin 2015 petition"" for direct links to sign.

Warning: graphic content! This is why we need your support 🙏🙏🙏! THIS IS WHY WE ARE DONATING 1️⃣0️⃣0️⃣% of ALL SALES to the incredible @RescueDogsRockNYC. This rescue saves some of the most severely abused and neglected dogs that we have EVER SEEN. Lukey was rescued by RDRNYC from a rural Texas Shelter where most dogs have no chance at survival. Lukey will not be a statistic, he will be an exception, one who makes it out alive- thanks to @RescueDogsRockNYC! 
Lukey has been abused & neglected for so long, he has spiraled into what you see. A life of pain & fear. Even though he was suffering, can't see due to his infected eyes, malnourished & weak, he remains sweet gentle & affectionate & trusting of all humans & other dogs. An incredible testament to Lukeys pureness & goodness. Lukey will suffer no more thanks to these wonderful humans at RDRNYC. They took him to their Texas vet partner for life saving care. Lukeys life matters. If you agree then please show your support. You can donate to Lukey at rescedogsrocknyc.org/donate or PayPal: donate@rescuedogsrocknyc.org or you can buy a charm at WagAware.com from NOW-2/22 and we will donate 1️⃣0️⃣0️⃣% of ALL SALES (minus postage) to @RescueDogsRockNYC so they can continue their amazing work.

Mom was able to put my leash on them and carry me. 2 of the 3 dog tags phone numbers were very hard to figure out. Check your dogs' tags and if your phone number is very small or rubbed off or faded at all please get a new tag with your phone number clear and large. All 3 dogs had gotten out of the house or a gate, or ran out an open door while a worker was there.

Q: Are you a boy or a girl?
A: I'm a Girl! 👧☺
Q: How old are you & when is your birthday? 
A: I'm 3 years old! My dog birthdate is June 30, 2011 🐶 and my bear birthdate is Oct 31, 2014 🐻
Q: Where do you live?
A: Southern California USA ☀
Q: What kind of dog are you?
A: I'm a Shih Tzu 😄
Q: Is Munchkin your real name?
A: Yes! I weighed 1 pound when mom got me so she named me Munchkin 😊
Q: Where did you get your bear suit?
A: Mom made it for me from a stuffed teddy bear! 🆒
Q: Do you live in your suit or wear it all day or sleep in it?
A: I live life like a regular doggie & only wear my suit for a few minutes for pictures & videos 📷🎥 (shhh don't tell the kids! 😉) My page is made to appear like I live as a teddy bear because it makes people happy, and I love making people happy! 😊
Q: What do you look like out of your suit?
A: There are a few pictures posted of me out of my suit & a bunch in my tagged pictures section from mom's page. You'll see a new picture posted of me out of my suit every once in a while! 🐶
Q: Are you comfortable in your suit, do you get hot, and do you like it?
A: My suit is thin, light, comfy & only covers the very front of me, less than t-shirts cover other doggies 👕 If I was uncomfortable I wouldn't be wearing it cause I'm the boss! 👊 I get to do a lot of fun stuff in it 😃 Thank you for being concerned about me and doggies! 💗
Q: Is it hard to put on and to walk in it?
A: It's very easy & fast to put on & take off,  and I walk & run in it the same as I do out of it, you can see in my YouTube videos! 🚶🏃📹
Q: How many legs do you have and how many do you stand & walk on?
A: I have 4 legs and I always stand & walk on all 4! My front paws are in my bear legs & my teddy bear arms are fake 🐾🐾
Q: Do you wear other clothes or suits?
A: I just wear my bear suit & sometimes put something over it for special occasions or holidays. I never wore any doggie clothes before my bear suit! 👚👖👗
Q: Are your pictures photoshopped?
A: Nope! My pictures are taken at an angle so you can't see my body or back legs behind me 😉😘🐶🐻",repost

SPOILER ALERTS😉
Q: Are you a boy or a girl?
A: I'm a Girl! 👧☺
Q: How old are you & when is your birthday? 
A: I'm 3 years old! My dog birthdate is June 30, 2011 🐶 and my bear birthdate is Oct 31, 2014 🐻
Q: Where do you live?
A: Southern California USA ☀
Q: What kind of dog are you?
A: I'm a Shih Tzu 😄
Q: Is Munchkin your real name?
A: Yes! I weighed 1 pound when mom got me so she named me Munchkin 😊
Q: Where did you get your bear suit?
A: Mom made it for me from a stuffed teddy bear! 🆒
Q: Do you live in your suit or wear it all day or sleep in it?
A: I live life like a regular doggie & only wear my suit for a few minutes for pictures & videos 📷🎥 (shhh don't tell the kids! 😉) My page is made to appear like I live as a teddy bear because it makes people happy, and I love making people happy! 😊
Q: What do you look like out of your suit?
A: There are a few pictures posted of me out of my suit & a bunch in my tagged pictures section from mom's page. You'll see a new picture postd of me out of my suit every once in a while! 🐶
Q: Are you comfortable in your suit, do you get hot, and do you like it?
A: My suit is thin, light, comfy & only covers the very front of me, less than t-shirts cover other doggies 👕 If I was uncomfortable I wouldn't be wearing it cause I'm the boss! 👊 I get to do a lot of fun stuff in it 😃 Thank you for being concerned about me and doggies! 💗
Q: Is it hard to put on and to walk in it?
A: It's very easy & fast to put on & take off,  and I walk & run in it the same as I do out of it, you can see in my YouTube videos! 🚶🏃📹
Q: How many legs do you have and how many do you stand & walk on?
A: I have 4 legs and I always stand & walk on all 4! My front paws are in my bear legs & my teddy bear arms are fake 🐾🐾
Q: Are your pictures photoshopped?
A: Nope! My pictures are taken at an angle so you can't see my body or back legs behind me 😉😘🐶🐻",

October is National Bullying Prevention Awareness month. Let's work all year round to stop bullying. Bullying happens in person and online.
If you're being bullied, you're not alone. If you see someone being bullied, stand up and help. If you are a bully, please stop and think of how you'd feel if you were being bullied 💗🐶🐻

・・・
#Repost @cupcake_napa_valley_dog
・・・
🚨🚨Urgent Please Read🚨🚨 We've waited to post this but cannot wait any longer❗If you or someone you know is or has used NexGard or Bravecto as a flea/tick preventative I'd strongly urge you to do a little research before administering any longer. 
Cupcake died just 6 days after her first dose of Nexgard and over a 2 day period she experienced  a seizure, signs of being poisened and neurological problems--ultimately she went into cardiac arrest and passed away. 
After doing diligent research, I've found that there are over 9,000 documented case of the same circumstances. Doing a simple Google search to read the product reviews will show you that people's dogs are literally dying daily❗️ And in some cases multiple pets have died (in the same household). I've found a network of a few thousand people that have experienced the same thing and all of them have met resistance from their Vet's office. 
At this point as responsible owners I beg you to do some research and or contact me to find out more info. Right now there are 2 Facebook Groups called ""Does NexGard Kill Dogs?"" and ""Does Bravecto Kill Dogs?"" I'd also suggest adding their groups and sharing your stories. The same company that makes NexGard also makes Frontline and they have been sued through 9 separate class action lawsuits for similar circumstances. Please guys let's all get together and make sure no more dogs die unnecessarily! Help us spread the word.

Thank you for taking the time to read this post. And please remember this is only my opinion and I'm only suggesting that you do further research.",repost

For new visitors & followers with questions & concerns ❤🐶🐻 Warning: SPOILER ALERTS 😉
Q: Are you a boy or a girl?
A: I'm a Girl! 👧☺
Q: How old are you & when is your birthday? 
A: I'm 4 years old! My dog birthdate is June 30, 2011 🐶 and my bear birthdate is Oct 31, 2014 🐻
Q: Where do you live?
A: Southern California USA ☀
Q: What kind of dog are you?
A: I'm a Shih Tzu 😄
Q: Is Munchkin your real name?
A: Yes! I weighed 1 pound when mom got me so she named me Munchkin 😊
Q: Why do you wear a bear suit?
A: I wore it Halloween 2014 & had a viral video 📹
I continue doing it cause it makes people happy, and I love making people happy! 😄
Q: Where did you get your bear suit?
A: Mom made it for me from a stuffed teddy bear 🆒
Q: Do you live in your suit/wear it all day/sleep in it?
A: I live life like a regular doggie & only wear my suit for a few minutes for pictures & videos 📷🎥
(shhh don't tell the kids! 😉) My page is made to appear like I live as a teddy bear 🐻
Q: What do you look like out of your suit?
A: You can search #NakeyMunchkin to see 🐶
Q: Are you comfortable in your suit, do you get hot, and do you like it?
A: My suit is thin, light, comfy & only covers the very front of me, less than t-shirts cover other doggies 👕 I live by the ocean so even when it's sunny out it's still cooler than inland. If I was uncomfortable I wouldn't be wearing it cause mom would never do anything to make me uncomfortable or unhappy. I get to do a lot of fun stuff in it 😃 Thank you for being concerned about me and doggies! 💗
Q: Is it hard to put on and to walk in it?
A: It's very easy & fast to put on & take off,  and I walk & run in it the same as I do out of it, you can see in my YouTube videos! 🚶🏃📹
Q: How many legs do you have and how many do you stand & walk on?
A: I have 4 legs and I always stand & walk on all 4! My front paws are in my bear legs & my teddy bear arms are fake 🐾🐾
Q: Do you wear other clothes or suits?
A: I just wear my bear suit & sometimes put something over it for special occasions 👗
Q: Are your pictures photoshopped?
A: Nope! My pictures are taken at an angle so you can't see my body or back legs behind me 📷","repost,nakeymunchkin"

IVDD is a chronic progressive disease with no cure that affects thousands of dogs worldwide. If you haven't heard of it before here is some info for you to be aware of in case your doggie or someone's you know has any of these symptoms. If you see any of these serious signs you should take your dog to the vet ASAP:
Neck pain; Abdominal tenderness or tenseness; Arched back; Sensitivity to movement; Impaired, incomplete or inappropriate urination or loss of bladder control; Dragging one or more legs when walking; “Toeing over” or “knuckling over” when walking or standing; Stiffness; Reluctance to rise; Tremors, trembling or shaking; Paralysis in one or more limbs
IVDD is more common in small breeds like Shih Tzus, Pekingese, Basset Hounds, Dachshunds and Beagles but larger breeds can get it as well

For new visitors & followers with questions & concerns ❤🐶🐻 Warning: SPOILER ALERTS 😉
Q: Are you a boy or a girl?
A: I'm a Girl! 👧☺
Q: How old are you & when is your birthday? 
A: I'm 3 years old! My dog birthdate is June 30, 2011 🐶 and my bear birthdate is Oct 31, 2014 🐻
Q: Where do you live?
A: Southern California USA ☀
Q: What kind of dog are you?
A: I'm a Shih Tzu 😄
Q: Is Munchkin your real name?
A: Yes! I weighed 1 pound when mom got me so she named me Munchkin 😊
Q: Why do you wear a bear suit?
A: I wore it Halloween 2014 & had a viral video 📹
I continue doing it cause it makes people happy, and I love making people happy! 😄
Q: Where did you get your bear suit?
A: Mom made it for me from a stuffed teddy bear 🆒
Q: Do you live in your suit/wear it all day/sleep in it?
A: I live life like a regular doggie & only wear my suit for a few minutes for pictures & videos 📷🎥
(shhh don't tell the kids! 😉) My page is made to appear like I live as a teddy bear 🐻
Q: What do you look like out of your suit?
A: You can search #NakeyMunchkin to see 🐶
Q: Are you comfortable in your suit, do you get hot, and do you like it?
A: My suit is thin, light, comfy & only covers the very front of me, less than t-shirts cover other doggies 👕 I live by the ocean so even when it's sunny out it's still cooler than inland. If I was uncomfortable I wouldn't be wearing it cause mom would never do anything to make me uncomfortable or unhappy. I get to do a lot of fun stuff in it 😃 Thank you for being concerned about me and doggies! 💗
Q: Is it hard to put on and to walk in it?
A: It's very easy & fast to put on & take off,  and I walk & run in it the same as I do out of it, you can see in my YouTube videos! 🚶🏃📹
Q: How many legs do you have and how many do you stand & walk on?
A: I have 4 legs and I always stand & walk on all 4! My front paws are in my bear legs & my teddy bear arms are fake 🐾🐾
Q: Do you wear other clothes or suits?
A: I just wear my bear suit & sometimes put something over it for special occasions 👗
Q: Are your pictures photoshopped?
A: Nope! My pictures are taken at an angle so you can't see my body or back legs behind me 😃🐶🐻","nakeymunchkin,repost"

Thank you all so much for your sweet messages about Boo. So many of you have been through the heartbreak of losing a pet, for whatever reason. A lot of you have had the same issues as Boo had with your pets, or are going thru them now and can relate. It does help to know that all of our loved pets are no longer in pain and that is the best we can do for them. Thank you so much for your love and care! ❤",

A few years ago she starting having thyroid and kidney problems and went thru all the different treatments available. Over time she gradually lost a lot of weight and muscle and had days of not feeling good. She started feeling worse in the last couple of months, so it was time to let her go. It was very hard and we miss her so much already. Boo was almost 17 years old and had a long happy life ever since mom adopted her at 8 weeks old.  She was mom's only pet until I came along, so she took a couple of months to get used to me.  She was never a lap cat or the cuddly type, so mom was pleasantly surprised how much she let me play with her and drive her crazy and how she got used to me showering her with love daily. If any of you are concerned about me playing with her in the video posted last week, please don't be. That was filmed a few months ago before she really started feeling badly. We love you Boo and we miss you, RIP 💔",

Above is a pic of Kyle taken soon after we adopted him almost 7 years ago. He had been residing at a no-kill animal rescue after witnessing a murder - a domestic violence fatality - that left him homeless. Adopting Kyle changed our lives. Not only does his glowing positivity (despite his traumatic past) remind us to be thankful everyday but he has given us this @instagram platform and inspired our family to use it to help others by raising awareness around the need for animal-friendly #domesticviolence shelters and... of course... by providing some daily #giggles. 💜💜💜,"domesticviolence,remembermethursday,remembertherescue,giggles"

Warning: SPOILER ALERTS 😉
Q: Are you a boy or a girl?
A: I'm a Girl! 👧☺
Q: How old are you & when is your birthday? 
A: I'm 4 years old! My dog birthdate is June 30, 2011 🐶 and my bear birthdate is Oct 31, 2014 🐻
Q: Where do you live?
A: Southern California USA ☀
Q: What kind of dog are you?
A: I'm a Shih Tzu 😄
Q: Is Munchkin your real name?
A: Yes! I weighed 1 pound when mom got me so she named me Munchkin 😊
Q: Why do you wear a bear suit?
A: I wore it Halloween 2014 & had a viral video 📹
I continue doing it cause it makes people happy, and I love making people happy! 😄
Q: Where did you get your bear suit?
A: Mom made it for me from a stuffed teddy bear 🆒
Q: Do you live in your suit/wear it all day/sleep in it?
A: I live life like a regular doggie & only wear my suit for a few minutes for pictures & videos 📷🎥
(shhh don't tell the kids! 😉) My page is made to appear like I live as a teddy bear 🐻
Q: What do you look like out of your suit?
A: You can search #NakeyMunchkin to see 🐶
Q: Are you comfortable in your suit, do you get hot, and do you like it?
A: My suit is thin, light, comfy & only covers the very front of me, less than t-shirts cover other doggies 👕 I live by the ocean so even when it's sunny out it's still cooler than inland. If I was uncomfortable I wouldn't be wearing it cause mom would never do anything to make me uncomfortable or unhappy. I get to do a lot of fun stuff in it 😃 Thank you for being concerned about me and doggies! 💗
Q: Is it hard to put on and to walk in it?
A: It's very easy & fast to put on & take off,  and I walk & run in it the same as I do out of it, you can see in my YouTube videos! 🚶🏃📹
Q: How many legs do you have and how many do you stand & walk on?
A: I have 4 legs and I always stand & walk on all 4! My front paws are in my bear legs & my teddy bear arms are fake 🐾🐾
Q: Do you wear other clothes or suits?
A: I just wear my bear suit & sometimes put something over it for special occasions 👗
Q: Are your pictures photoshopped?
A: Nope! My pictures are taken at an angle so you can't see my body or back legs 📷","repost,nakeymunchkin"

Most of you know we moved to Miami last year but don't know the reason. My mom was diagnosed with lung cancer just over a year ago and we knew she didn't have a lot of time left, so we moved here to be with her. She was Munchkin's biggest fan from the day I brought her home. She was with Munchkin and I every minute of Munchkin's first two weeks at home, and Munchkin was laying with her when she passed.
She was a huge dog lover and nothing made her happier than her ""granddog"", dogs and her family. In this last year she became more like a dog, as all she wanted to do was be outside, eat, nap, and go to the dog park! We hope all the dogs in heaven are with her to make her happy. We will miss her terribly but we'll be back to living life as usual very soon because that's exactly what she said she wants us to do. RIP mom, you were the best grandma to Munchkin and we love you so much! ❤️ Munchkin's mom Cindy",

Q: Are you a boy or a girl?
A: I'm a Girl 👧☺
Q: How old are you & when is your birthday? 
A: I'm 4 years old. My dog birthdate is June 30, 2011 🐶 & my bear birthdate is Oct 31, 2014 🐻
Q: Where do you live?
A: Southern California USA ☀
Q: What kind of dog are you?
A: I'm a Shih Tzu 🐶
Q: Is Munchkin your real name?
A: Yes! I weighed 1 pound when mom got me so she named me Munchkin 😊
Q: Why do you wear a bear suit?
A: I wore it for Halloween 2014 & had a viral video 📹 I continue doing it cause it makes people happy, and I love making people happy! 😄
Q: Where did you get your bear suit?
A: Mom made it for me from a stuffed teddy bear
Q: Do you live in your suit/wear it all day/sleep in it?
A: I live life like a regular doggie & only wear my suit for a few minutes for pictures & videos 📷🎥
(shhh don't tell the kids! 😉) My page is made to appear like I live as a teddy bear 🐻
Q: What do you look like out of your suit?
A: You can search #NakeyMunchkin to see 🐶
Q: Are you comfortable in your suit, do you get hot, and do you like it?
A: My suit is thin, light, comfy & only covers the very front of me, less than t-shirts cover other doggies 👕 I live by the ocean so even when it's sunny out it's still cooler than inland, and I don't wear it if it's more than 75°F out. If I was uncomfortable I wouldn't be wearing it cause mom would never do anything to make me uncomfortable or unhappy. I get to do a lot of fun stuff in it 😃 Thank you for being concerned about me and doggies! 💗
Q: Is it hard to put on and to walk in it?
A: It's very easy & fast to put on & take off,  and I walk & run in it the same as I do out of it, you can see in my YouTube videos 🚶🏃📹
Q: How many legs do you have and how many do you stand & walk on?
A: I have 4 legs and I always stand & walk on all 4. My front paws are in my bear legs & my teddy bear arms are fake 🐾🐾
Q: Do you wear other clothes or suits?
A: I just wear my bear suit & sometimes wear something over it 👗
Q: Are your pictures photoshopped?
A: Nope! My pictures are taken at an angle so you can't see my body or back legs 👍

As we kickoff #2016, Kyle and I would like to thank you for the amazing #2015 you made happen for us! We never anticipated how #amazeballs the @instagram community would be towards Kyle. He is the most #precious thing to our family and we feel so thankful we are able to share him!!! We also continued to be amazed by the support you bring to our #CatsAgainstDV awareness campaign. In #2015 we were able to raise over $3,500 to support #animalfriendly #domesticviolence shelters and our #CatsAgainstDV hashtag was used over 600 times!!! We are so happy you understand and respect our position to keep Kyle's image 100% non-profit and we look forward to working with more sponsors in #2016 to raise even more money for the #SafePlaceforPets cause. But perhaps even more importantly, we look forward to getting to share more of Kyle's #gloriousstache with you!!! Here's to a happy and healthy new year! 🍻🍻🍻 Sincerely,

Jen & Kyle

""Tinkerbelle is THE best big sister ever! You all know that Meeko is in heat, so I am very careful about where I take them on walks and how close they get to other dogs because there is no need for her to get pregnant now. However, this morning an unleashed, un-neutered dog flew around a corner, so I scooped Meeko up to protect her. The dog started attacking me trying to get to Meeks and Tinkerbelle got protective. My sweet 50 pound fluffy fought off an 85 pound lab/pit mix to protect me and her sister until the dog's owner could get him under control. Thankfully no one was hurt other than just scratches, but this story shows that even if you think your pup is super well behaved and obedient, leash laws in public are there for a reason! If the dog had been wearing a leash this whole episode could have been avoided! Needless to say Tink gets LOTS of treats today!"" Please pay attention to your pups and if they aren't 100% obedient- leash them!",

Warning: SPOILER ALERTS 😉
Q: Are you a boy or a girl?
A: I'm a Girl 👧☺
Q: How old are you & when is your birthday? 
A: I'm 4 years old. My dog dob is June 30, 2011 🐶 & my bear dob is Oct 31, 2014 🐻
Q: Where do you live?
A: Southern California USA ☀
Q: What kind of dog are you?
A: I'm a Shih Tzu 🐶
Q: Is Munchkin your real name?
A: Yes! I weighed 1 pound when mom got me so she named me Munchkin 😊
Q: Why do you wear a bear suit?
A: I wore it for Halloween 2014 & had a viral video 📹 I continue doing it because I have fun & it makes people happy and I love making people happy! 😄
Q: Where did you get your bear suit?
A: Mom made it from a stuffed teddy bear
Q: Do you live in your suit/wear it all day/sleep in it?
A: I live life like a regular doggie & only wear my suit for a few minutes for pictures & videos 📷🎥
(shhh don't tell the kids! 😉) My page is made to appear like I live as a teddy bear 🐻
Q: What do you look like out of your suit?
A: You can see posts of me as a dog every Wednesday & you can also search #NakeyMunchkin to see more pics & videos 🐶
Q: Are you comfortable in your suit, do you get hot, and do you like it?
A: My suit is thin, light, comfy & only covers the very front of me, less than t-shirts cover other dogs 👕, and I don't wear it if it's more than 75°F out. If I was uncomfortable I wouldn't be wearing it cause mom would never do anything to make me uncomfortable or unhappy. Thank you for being concerned about me and dogs! 💗
Q: Is it hard to put on and to walk in it?
A: It's very easy & fast to put on & take off,  and I walk & run in it the same as I do out of it. You can see in my videos posted & on YouTube 🚶🏃📹
Q: How many legs do you have and how many do you stand & walk on?
A: I have 4 legs and I always stand & walk on all 4. My front paws are in my bear legs & my teddy bear arms are fake 🐾🐾
Q: Do you wear other clothes or suits?
A: I just wear my bear suit & sometimes wear something over it 👗
Q: Are your pictures photoshopped?
A: Nope! My pictures are taken at an angle so you can't see my body or back legs 👍

Warning: SPOILER ALERTS 😉
Q: Are you a boy or a girl?
A: I'm a Girl 👧☺
Q: How old are you & when is your birthday? 
A: I'm 4 years old. My dog dob is June 30, 2011 🐶 & my bear dob is Oct 31, 2014 🐻
Q: Where do you live?
A: Southern California USA ☀
Q: What kind of dog are you?
A: I'm a Shih Tzu 🐶
Q: Is Munchkin your real name?
A: Yes! I weighed 1 pound when mom got me so she named me Munchkin 😊
Q: Why do you wear a bear suit?
A: I wore it for Halloween 2014 & had a viral video 📹 I continue doing it because I have fun & it makes people happy and I love making people happy! 😄
Q: Where did you get your bear suit?
A: Mom made it from a stuffed teddy bear
Q: Do you live in your suit/wear it all day/sleep in it?
A: I live life like a regular doggie & only wear my suit for a few minutes for pictures & videos 📷🎥
(shhh don't tell the kids! 😉) My page is made to appear like I live as a teddy bear 🐻
Q: What do you look like out of your suit?
A: You can see posts of me as a dog every Wednesday & you can also search #NakeyMunchkin to see more pics & videos 🐶
Q: Are you comfortable in your suit, do you get hot, and do you like it?
A: My suit is thin, light, comfy & only covers the very front of me, less than t-shirts cover other dogs 👕, and I don't wear it if it's more than 75°F out. If I was uncomfortable I wouldn't be wearing it cause mom would never do anything to make me uncomfortable or unhappy. Thank you for being concerned about me and dogs! 💗
Q: Is it hard to put on and to walk in it?
A: It's very easy & fast to put on & take off,  and I walk & run in it the same as I do out of it. You can see in my videos posted & on YouTube 🚶🏃📹
Q: How many legs do you have and how many do you stand & walk on?
A: I have 4 legs and I always stand & walk on all 4. My front paws are in my bear legs & my teddy bear arms are fake 🐾🐾
Q: Do you wear other clothes or suits?
A: I just wear my bear suit & sometimes wear something over it 👗
Q: Are your pictures photoshopped?
A: Nope! My pictures are taken at an angle so you can't see my body or back legs 👍

For those of you who don't know, Rotti was diagnosed with Spindle Cell Sarcoma and IVDD [one of many things he's powered through], which unfortunately meant Rotti's time was limited. @Queensbeststumpydogrescue and many others created a bucket list where he enjoyed many things most other pups haven't enjoyed yet. Rotti has gone through so much but despite everything, he had chose to continue to live life to the fullest. Thanks for being an inspiration to us all. #LoveYouAlways",loveyoualways

9867,https://www.instagram.com/p/BPqQRMQF078/,2572,151,"7 years ago today we #adopted this #special #beast from a no-kill animal shelter in the #midwest. It was there we learned this #gorgeous, #hotmess of a creature had ""witnessed a murder,"" something we wouldn't quite grasp the significance of until we joined #insta years later. On our way home from the shelter we heard a creepy wheezing sound emanating from the carrier in the back seat... and so he was given the name Kyle after #KyleBroflovski's cousin Kyle, #Kyle1, who creepily wheezes when he breaths. 💜 I initially joined #insta to immortalize this #precious soul. He was just so #ridiculous and came with such an amazing personality that I wanted the whole world to know... and to never forget. I can't believe that we accomplished that and so much more. This #COIcommunity has given Kyle (and our family) so much more purpose over these past 3 years that my love for him has gotten even more #outtacontrol. I honestly can't imagine a day with no Kyle in my life. Which is why it's a bummer for me to share with you that we are spending Kyle's #adoptaversary in the vet. Over the past year, Kyle has lost a lot of weight. The reality is he's an #oldman which comes with things like cataracts and kidney disease. The great news is that there has been 0% reduction in the demand for #lapsforKyle and he is behaving 100% normal. This #adoptaversary is serving as a friendly reminder to us all to be grateful for every second we have with this #preciousboy. We love you to the moon and back, Kyle, and we'll take whatever more time we can get out of you! Now stuff that #gorgeous face of yours! 😘💜 #kylehadteethonce #gotchaday #tbt #adoptdontshop #whorescuedwho","kyle1,ridiculous,beast,outtacontrol,preciousboy,oldman,adoptaversary,midwest,insta,adopted,gorgeous,hotmess,lapsforkyle,special,coicommunity,precious,tbt,adoptdontshop,whorescuedwho,kylebroflovski,gotchaday,kylehadteethonce"

No more bread for ducks! 🚫🍞
Did you know that you are not supposed to feed ducks bread?? It makes them sick because it lacks the calories and nutrition they need to help keep them warm in winter. The rotting bread also pollutes the water leaving surface algae, kills fish and gives ducks diseases. Instead of feeding them bread they like half cut seedless grapes (no grapes for dogs tho!), cooked rice, birdseed, peas, corn, oats and chopped lettuce #TheMoreYouKnow",themoreyouknow
